🚦 Intelligent Traffic Management Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

Cities struggle to monitor traffic congestion and provide actionable insights for traffic control.

This project aims to develop a Traffic Monitoring System that collects simulated traffic data (from IoT sensors or CSV logs) and displays real-time insights through a web dashboard.

The system focuses on automation, CI/CD, containerization, monitoring, and scalable deployment using DevOps tools, without implementing AI prediction models.

🎯 Objectives

Collect and process simulated traffic data

Display congestion levels and peak times in a real-time dashboard

Automate build and deployment pipelines

Ensure scalability using Kubernetes

Monitor system performance and generate alerts

🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of:

Traffic Data Collection Service (Dockerized)

Web Dashboard

CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins

Docker Containers

Kubernetes Cluster for scalability

Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring

Nginx as Reverse Proxy

Terraform for AWS Infrastructure provisioning

Ansible for server configuration

Git for version control

📦 Deliverables

Traffic Data Collection Service (CSV or simulated sensor inputs – Dockerized)
